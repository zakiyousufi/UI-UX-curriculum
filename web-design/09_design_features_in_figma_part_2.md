    **Variants**
    - Variants are design elements that allow you to create multiple versions of a component with different states, styles, or properties. This video explains how to use variants in Figma to create interactive and dynamic designs.

    **Interactive Components**
    - Interactive components are design elements that allow you to create interactive and dynamic designs with hover, click, and other interactive states. This video covers how to use interactive components in Figma to create engaging and interactive designs.

    **Masks**
    - Masks are design elements that allow you to clip or hide parts of an object or image to create custom shapes and effects. This video explains how to use masks in Figma to create visually appealing and creative designs.

    **Branching and Merging**
    - Branching and merging are tools that allow you to create different versions of a design and merge them back together. This video covers how to use branching and merging in Figma to create multiple design iterations and collaborate with team members effectively.
