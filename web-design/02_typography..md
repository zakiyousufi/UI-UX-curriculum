    **How to choose fonts**
    - Choosing fonts is an important aspect of design and it can greatly influence the perception of your content. Here are some steps to guide you:
    Understand the Brand or Message: The font should align with the personality of the brand or the message you want to convey. For example, a playful font might not be suitable for a formal business document.
    Consider Readability: The font should be easy to read. This is especially important for large blocks of text.
    Consider the Medium: The font should be suitable for the medium where it will be used. For example, some fonts look good on print but not on screens, and vice versa.
    Limit the Number of Fonts: Using too many different fonts can make the design look cluttered. A good rule of thumb is to use no more than 2-3 different fonts.
    Test Different Options: Try out different fonts and see which one works best. Consider factors like size, spacing, and color.
    Use Font Pairing Tools: There are online tools that can suggest fonts that go well together.Remember, the goal is to choose a font that enhances your message and makes it easy for the audience to understand.
