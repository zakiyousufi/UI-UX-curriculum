## 📝 Description
> Figma is a collaborative interface design tool that enables real-time collaboration, prototyping, and vector-based graphics creation for teams. In this section, you will learn how to use Figma to create design elements, apply styling, and create responsive designs.

**Boolean Operations**
- Boolean operations are tools that allow you to combine shapes and create complex shapes by adding, subtracting, intersecting, or excluding shapes. This video explains how to use boolean operations in Figma to create custom shapes and designs.
    
    - **Union**: Combines two or more shapes into a single shape.
    - **Subtract**: Removes the overlapping area of one shape from another.
    - **Intersect**: Creates a shape from the overlapping area of two shapes.
    - **Exclude**: Removes the overlapping area of two shapes, leaving only the non-overlapping areas.

**Importing and Exporting Assets**
- Importing and exporting assets is an essential part of the design process, as it allows you to bring in external assets such as images, icons, and other design elements into your Figma projects. This video covers how to import and export assets in Figma to enhance your designs.
    - **Importing Assets**: You can import images, icons, and other design elements into Figma by dragging and dropping them into your project or using the import feature.
    - **Exporting Assets**: You can export assets from Figma by selecting the objects you want to export and using the export feature to save them as PNG, SVG, or other file formats.

**Aligning and Distributing Objects**
- Aligning and distributing objects is a crucial step in creating visually appealing and well-organized designs. This video explains how to use alignment and distribution tools in Figma to align and distribute objects evenly in your designs.

**Layout Grids**
- Layout grids are tools that help you create consistent and well-organized designs by defining columns, rows, and gutters in your layout. This video covers how to use layout grids in Figma to create responsive designs and maintain consistency in your layouts.
