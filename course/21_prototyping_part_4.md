## 📝 Description
> Prototyping is an essential part of the design process. It allows you to test your ideas, gather feedback, and refine your designs before you start coding. In this section, you will learn how to create interactive prototypes using Figma. You will learn how to create clickable prototypes, add animations, and create interactive forms. By the end of this section, you will have the skills to create high-fidelity prototypes that look and feel like real websites or apps.

    **Prepare for Handoff**
    - Preparing for handoff is an essential part of the design process. It allows you to share your designs with developers and other stakeholders effectively. In this video, you will learn how to prepare your designs for handoff using Figma. You will learn how to create design specs, export assets, and generate code snippets. By the end of this section, you will have the skills to share your designs with your team and get feedback effectively.
