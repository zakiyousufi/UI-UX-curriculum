## 📝 Description
> A personal portfolio typically refers to a collection of materials or artifacts that showcase an individual's skills, accomplishments, experiences, and qualifications. It's commonly used by professionals, such as artists, designers, writers, programmers, and other creative or technical professionals, to demonstrate their expertise and abilities to potential employers, clients, or collaborators. A personal portfolio can take many forms, including a physical portfolio, a digital portfolio, or a combination of both. In this project, you will create a personal portfolio website using Figma. You will apply the design principles you have learned in the previous sections to create a visually appealing and cohesive design that showcases your skills and accomplishments.
