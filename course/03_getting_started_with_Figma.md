#### What's Figma?
Figma is a cloud-based design tool that is similar to Sketch in functionality and features, but with big differences that make Figma better for team collaboration. Figma is free to use. Figma is a vector graphics editor and prototyping tool which is primarily web-based, with additional offline features enabled by desktop applications for macOS and Windows. The Figma Mirror companion apps for Android and iOS allow viewing Figma prototypes on mobile devices. The feature set of Figma focuses on use in user interface and user experience design, with an emphasis on real-time collaboration.

#### Figma Shape tools
The shape tool is used to create rectangles, circles, and polygons. It is located in the toolbar on the left side of the Figma interface and can be accessed by clicking on the rectangle, circle, or polygon icon.

- **Pen tool & Vector Networks:** 
    The pen tool is used to create custom shapes and paths in Figma. It is located in the toolbar on the left side of the Figma interface.

    Vector networks are a new feature in Figma that allows you to create complex shapes and paths with ease. They are similar to vector paths in other design tools but offer more flexibility and control over the shape of your designs.
